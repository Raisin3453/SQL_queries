What is the average amount paid by the top 5 customers?

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS spending_average
FROM (SELECT A.customer_id,
		A.first_name,
		A.last_name,
		D.country,
		C.city,
		SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
